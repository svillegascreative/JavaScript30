# \#15 localStorage and Event Delegation

## Exercise
Using a provided form, allow the user to add items to a list and toggle a checkbox for each without refreshing the page. Persist the changes by recording them in localStorage.

## Impressions
- I appreciate that this was a todo list exercise disguised as something other than a todo list.
- I loved the checkbox hack with the taco. I love that even though this is the same as I've seen done with FontAwesome icons, this somehow still amused and surprised me. The little things...
- This video covered a lot of new stuff that required a bit of different thinking than previous exercises, so it was harder to code ahead. When I tried, and got stuck, I found that there was a lot more being done than needed at a given time. Of course, this is because Wes, being the tutor and creator of the exercise, knew what was coming up and coded things in a way that would help in later steps. When you're just learning and don't know enough to predict those future steps, the extra code can be distracting. Rather than go along and add it to my code "because Wes did and I guess I need it", I left it out until later, when I got to the part where I saw and understood the need.
- More exposure to `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` helped to elucidate their use and value.
