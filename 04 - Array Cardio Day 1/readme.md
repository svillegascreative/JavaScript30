# \#4 - Array Cardio Day 1

## Exercise
A console-only JS practice suite: 8 exercises focused on manipulating arrays of objects and strings, particularly using `filter()`, `sort()`, `map()`, and `reduce()`.

## Impressions
- `console.table()` is a really neat way to view data (arrays and objects) in the console.
- `reduce()` seems complex and yet flexible; warrants further study.
- Don't forget that a collection of DOM elements fetched by `document.querySelectorAll` is a node list, not an array. To manipulate it as an array, you can convert it using `Array.from()`.
