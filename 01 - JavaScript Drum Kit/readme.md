# \#1 - JS Drum Kit

## Exercise
Turn the keyboard into a drum kit: play a sound and animate the corresponding letter 'key' on the display.

## Impressions
- This was my first time using sound in any web project, and as such, it was also my first time using `<audio>` elements. Understanding the need to reset the start of the audio file with `audio.currentTime = 0;` in `playSound()` is key to getting immediate playback on each keypress.

- I finally got the story on `data-` attributes. I guess I'd kind of figured it out already, and hadn't yet bothered to look it up, but it was nice to hear it explained clearly, and learning that it was as I'd imagined. Very useful to keep in mind for future use.

- It was interesting and useful to learn about key codes. Could be useful for games and possibly accessibility.
