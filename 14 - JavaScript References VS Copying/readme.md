# \#14 - Javascript References vs. Copying

## Exercise
Just a quick exploration of what it means to reference a variable (integer, string, array, or simple or nested object) versus copy it, and what happens when you make changes to your new variable.

## Impressions
- Nothing here surprised me too much. `Object.assign()` was new to me, but pretty straightforward; key to know it only works one level deep.
