# \#17 - Sort Without Articles

## Exercise
Sort an array of band names into alphabetical order, ignoring any leading articles ("A", "An", "The"), then display them in the `<ul>`.

## Impressions
- This seemed straightforward enough so I tried to code ahead. I set up some pseudocode initially, and soon realized I probably would need to use a `RegExp` to represent the articles (or jump through a ridiculous set of unnecessary hoops), so I had to bail and follow the video.
