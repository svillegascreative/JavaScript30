# \#6 - Type Ahead

## Exercise
Using an API that returns an array of 1000 US cities, create an interactive search field that recognizes input and displays a list of suggested records.

## Impressions
- My first encounter with `fetch()`; seems pretty tidy (even if I'm still wrapping my head around promises).
- Regular expressions always make me a little queasy...
